# Prospects

## On tools to use

* Should use [commonmark-react-renderer](https://github.com/rexxars/commonmark-react-renderer) for Markdown rendering so that performance can stay ideal.

## On tasks to do

* Update `baobab-react` to support the new `dispatcher` paradigm and fix its HMR concerning cursors.
